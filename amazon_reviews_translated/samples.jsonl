I live on a budget. $5 changes in prices in what I buy add up, and quickly. I am absolutely disgusted.

I can confirm on two separate occasions this specific case being the root cause of my 2015 and 2017 iPads from bending. It doesn\u2019t happen immediately, but in both my devices it was after a month or so with the case on. On the 2015 it was slight, but I knew it damaged my 2017 as it was actually a brand new refurbish I had recently acquired. It went out of the packaging straight into the case. Kept solely in the house away from any other products, so there was no reason for it to get bent. The case is a super tight fit around the iPad. And while I once thought that was a positive, it obviously is a huge design flaw which will damage your very expensive tablet. Thank goodness I opted for AppleCare on mine, so it was a relatively painless device swap. BUYER BEWARE; you will risk bending using this case for prolonged amount of time.

Design flaw. Using a binder clip to keep that long bar in place. Update: Have caught 9 so far, but trigger needs modified or this is just a squirrel feeder. Bend it straighter, file round edge flat, make it more hair trigger. As delivered, squirrel can stand on trigger pad and eat the bait. Or steal the bait container. I wound up wiring a bottle cap to the cage, just below the trigger pad, so they can't steal the whole container of bait.

On a side note, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s related or not, but I recently just got the biggest most painful blister on my heel. I think it\u2019s related to the peel mask because maybe it made the skin too thin on the heel and it rubbed it raw. I always wear sneakers without socks and I never got a blister like this until I tried this mask. I think the mask is a great idea and I\u2019m sure if this peeling ever stops that my feet will be the softest they\u2019ve been in years. But right now they are messy and the heel is painful.

We installed the cubbies in different angles ( not all the openings going the same way ) because we thought she would enjoy that and she does. She never uses the scratching posts lol. The little toy that is attached to the top bed, she absolutely loves. My only other issue with this condo is the top part (the bed) It\u2019s just a soft cover over a piece of wood.

Often, playback is stopped as a result of these interactions. Con: The remote works, but reception at the unit is a little sketchy from just a couple feet away.

It has worked like a charm. I only put it on her when she is showing the inappropriate behaviors and after the first day she has already improved dramatically. We are on day 3 and I only had to put it on her once. I have only had to use the vibration setting to achieve the desired results. I have an older GSD that likes to bark at everything that drives by when he is in a certain room of the house. I am going to get one for him. The only improvement feedback I would give is that the collar was turned on but I had just taken it off my dog when she barked in excitement.

I shook the bottom caps in, only 3 were upside down. Pressed on the spring loaded tray to get them to raise up, the grabbed them with the tweezers to flip. Easy. Took 10 min to fill 100 caps and snap the tops on. Done and done. I'm filling with coral calcium, MSM and another batch was tumeric extract. Works like a champ. Directions were good. I'm retired military so the clear and direct instructions were great. For efficiency, buy caps that are pre seperated. I didn't, but sat and watched TV the night before and seperated them out. I only saved a few bucks buying the non seperated caps. So maybe spend a few bucks more and save yourself some time. If your looking for a fast capsule filler, this is it. Just buy it.
